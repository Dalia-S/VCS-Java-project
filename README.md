# VCS-Java-project
Vilnius Coding School final Java/MySQL project "Top Sport" - lottery type games with user registration/log in, additional "manage users/games" options for Admin.

Top Sport connects to MySQL TopSportDB (user 'root', password 'root'). If you like to run the program, please create the database TopSportDB or amend connection in DBConn.java file accordingly.

Register as a new user for regular experience or use user: 'admin' password: 'admin' to see additional features.
